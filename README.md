# Car Dealership Database Project

## Create an ERD for a car dealership.

1. The dealership sells both new and used cars, and it operates a service facility. Base your design on the following business rules:
2. A salesperson may sell many cars, but each car is sold by only one salesperson.
3. A customer may buy many cars, but each car is purchased by only one customer.
4. A salesperson writes a single invoice for each car he or she sells.
5. A customer gets an invoice for each car he or she buys.
6. A customer may come in just to have his or her car serviced; that is, a customer need not buy a car to be classified as a customer.
7. When a customer takes one or more cars in for repair or service, one service ticket is written for each car.
8. The car dealership maintains a service history for each of the cars serviced. The service  records are referenced by the carâ€™s serial number (VIN).
9. A car brought in for service can be worked on by many mechanics, and each mechanic may work on many cars.
10. A car that is serviced may or may not need parts (e.g., adjusting a carburetor or cleaning a fuel injector nozzle does not require providing new parts).

After the tables have been created, use SQL to add data to the database at least 5 entries per table.
Also, create a stored procedure or function.
